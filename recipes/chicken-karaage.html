        <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
            <h3>For the Chicken</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>680 g boneless, skin-on chicken thighs (roughly 4-6 pieces)</li>
                    <li>½ tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
                    <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp potato starch or cornstarch (more if necessary)</li>
                    <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour) (more if necessary)</li>
                    <li>960 ml neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.) (for deep-frying)</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>For the Seasonings</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
                    <li>½ Tbsp soy sauce</li>
                    <li>½ Tbsp sake (you can substitute with dry sherry or Chinese rice wine, or omit it)</li>
                    <li>½ tsp roasted sesame oil</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>For Serving (Optional)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>lemon wedges</li>
                    <li>Japanese mayonnaise (for dipping)</li>
                    <li>shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) (for a spicy taste)</li>
                </ul>
        <h4>COOK TIME</h4>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Cut each chicken thigh into 2-inch pieces and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                    <li>Grate the ginger (you will only need ½ tsp) and mince the garlic (I love this garlic press).</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sake, and sesame oil. Whisk it all together.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken to the bowl and mix it with your hands. Cover and keep in the refrigerator to marinate for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pour the oil into a heavy-bottomed pot (I used a Dutch oven) and heat it to 325ºF (163ºC) on medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, prepare the potato starch and all-purpose flour in separate piles.</li>
                    <li>First, lightly dredge each marinated chicken piece in the flour and dust off the excess flour. Then, dredge it in the potato starch and remove the excess starch.</li>
                    <li>Continue with the remaining chicken pieces.</li>
                    <li>When the oil temperature has reached 325ºF (163ºC) (you’ll know it’s ready when you insert a wooden chopstick into the oil and small bubbles appear around it), gently submerge each chicken piece in the oil. Do not overcrowd the pot; add only 3-5 pieces at a time. If you put too many pieces in at once, the oil temperature will drop quickly, and the chicken will end up absorbing too much oil.</li>
                    <li>First Deep-Frying: Deep-fry for 90 seconds, or until the outside of the chicken is a light golden color. If the chicken browns too quickly, then the oil temperature is too high. Either put a few more pieces of chicken in the oil or lower the heat. Controlling the oil temperature at all times is very important for deep-frying. Transfer the chicken pieces to a wire rack to drain the excess oil.</li>
                    <li>The residual heat will continue to cook the chicken as it rests on the wire rack. Continue deep-frying the remaining chicken pieces. Between batches, pick up and discard the crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh sieve. This keeps the oil clean and prevents it from becoming darker.</li>
                    <li>Second Deep-Frying: Now, heat the oil to 350ºF (177ºC). Place 3 to 5 pieces of the resting chicken back into the oil and deep-fry for 45 seconds, or until the skin is golden brown and crispy. Transfer them to a wire rack to drain the excess oil. Continue with the remaining chicken pieces.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>To Serve</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Serve the chicken hot. Karaage is often served with a wedge of lemon and Japanese mayonnaise. Sprinkle shichimi togarashi for a bit of spice, if desired.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>To Store</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Deep-fry all the chicken pieces, let cool completely, and keep in an airtight container. You can store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for up to a month.</li>
                </ol>
